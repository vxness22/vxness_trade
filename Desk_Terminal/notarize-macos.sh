# Build, sign, notarise and staple a distributable macOS dmg.
#
# This is the step that makes the download actually work for someone who is
# not us. build-macos.sh alone produces an ad-hoc signed app: it runs on the
# machine that built it and nowhere else. Anything downloaded from the web
# carries a quarantine flag, and macOS refuses to launch a quarantined app
# that Apple has not notarised — with "Vxness Terminal is damaged and can't
# be opened", which reads as a corrupt download rather than a missing
# certificate. Apple's own syspolicy_check calls it out in as many words:
#
#     Notary Ticket Missing … Severity: Fatal
#
# There is no build flag, entitlement or workaround that avoids this. The only
# fix is a Developer ID certificate plus a round trip through Apple's notary
# service, which is what this script automates.
#
# Usage:
#   TX_SIGN_ID="Developer ID Application: Acme Ltd (AB12CD34EF)" \
#   TX_APPLE_ID="you@example.com" \
#   TX_TEAM_ID="AB12CD34EF" \
#   TX_APPLE_PASSWORD="abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop" \
#   ./notarize-macos.sh
#
# TX_APPLE_PASSWORD is an APP-SPECIFIC password from appleid.apple.com, not
# the Apple ID password itself. Generate one at:
#   appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords
#
# Alternatively store the credentials once in the keychain and skip three of
# the four variables:
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials vxness-notary \
#       --apple-id <id> --team-id <TEAMID> --password <app-specific-pw>
#   TX_SIGN_ID="..." TX_NOTARY_PROFILE=vxness-notary ./notarize-macos.sh
