// Economic calendar — the macro releases that move the instruments this
// terminal trades (rate decisions, CPI, NFP, GDP), as a tab beside
// Trade / Pending / History / News.
//
// Built the same way NewsPanel is, and for the same reason: the Vxness
// gateway serves prices and trading, not macro data, so rather than stand up a
// calendar service both clients could drift apart on, this embeds TradingView's
// public events widget. It is free and needs no API key — the same terms the
// news timeline already runs on.
//
// Two filters, because an unfiltered calendar is noise. A forex trader watches
// the currencies they hold:
//   * Importance — "high impact only" is the everyday setting.
//   * Countries  — either the majors, or just the economies behind the symbol
//     in focus (EURUSD -> eu + us). MT5's calendar filters the same way.
//
// Consequences worth knowing, inherited from the news panel:
//   * It needs to reach tradingview-widget.com. Everything else in the terminal
//     talks only to the Vxness API, so this tab can be blank on a network that
//     permits one and not the other. It says so rather than showing white.
//   * The renderer process (~150 MB) is only paid for once the tab is opened.
