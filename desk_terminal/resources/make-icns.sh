#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds resources/vxness.icns — the macOS app icon — from a square PNG master.
#
# macOS will not take the .ico (that is a Windows container) and CMake needs a
# real .icns to drop into Contents/Resources, so this is the mac equivalent of
# what app.rc does on Windows.
#
# Source preference:
#   1. resources/vxness-1024.png   (ideal — every slot is a true downscale)
#   2. resources/vxness-256.png    (what the repo ships; 512/1024 are upscaled)
#
# The 256px master is the app-icon artwork proper: the dark rounded-square tile,
# NOT frontend/trader/public/marketing/vxness_fevicon.png, which is 512px but a
# bare mark on white — correct as a favicon, wrong as a macOS app icon, which is
# always a tile. Upscaling the right artwork beats downscaling the wrong one.
# Drop a 1024px tile in as vxness-1024.png and this script picks it up with no
# other change.
#
# Only sips + iconutil are used, both of which ship with macOS — no Homebrew,
# no ImageMagick.
