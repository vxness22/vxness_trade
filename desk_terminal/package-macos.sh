!!  This dmg is AD-HOC SIGNED, not notarised.
    On the build machine it opens normally. On anyone else's Mac, Gatekeeper
    will say "damaged and can't be opened". Two ways forward:

    a) For testers — they run this once after copying it to Applications:
           xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Vxness Terminal.app"

    b) For the website download — sign and notarise properly with an Apple
       Developer account ($99/yr), then staple the ticket:
           TX_SIGN_ID="Developer ID Application: <Name> (<TEAMID>)" ./build-macos.sh
           ./package-macos.sh
           xcrun notarytool submit <dmg> --apple-id <id> --team-id <TEAMID> \
                                         --password <app-specific-pw> --wait
           xcrun stapler staple <dmg>
       Only (b) gives the same click-and-run experience as the Windows
       installer.
